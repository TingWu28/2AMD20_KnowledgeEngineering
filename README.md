## Project Research Question:

Client: Albert Heijn

Goal: Improve the user interaction in the AH app
- RQ1 – Sustainable Recipe Recommendation Based on Home Ingredients
For the client Albert Heijn, and in order to improve user interaction in the AH app, how can we recommend recipes that make optimal use of ingredients users already have at home—requiring the fewest possible additional ingredients—to support budget-conscious grocery shopping and reduce food waste?

- RQ2 – Personalized Recipe Filtering for Dietary Needs
To enhance user experience in the AH app for Albert Heijn, how can we recommend recipes that incorporate a user-preferred ingredient while also filtering based on individual dietary needs, such as vegetarian preferences or food allergies, so users can easily find recipes that match their personal requirements?
